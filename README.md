A simple web application that allows users to view a list of cocktails and their ingredients and add them to an order queue. They can navigate back to home and view the queue of cocktails they have ordered. The user can also remove cocktails from the queue. In order to view the cocktails, the corresponding API must be running. The API can be found [here](https://github.com/BigFoot-adventures/bartender-app-api).
